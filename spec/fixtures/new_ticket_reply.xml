      I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm
      quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've
      moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the
      window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married, but then,
      they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my
      Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the
      staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take
      my stapler then I'll set the building on fire.
